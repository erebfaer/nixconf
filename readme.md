# Nix Config

This is for personal use. Don't trust me to do anything.

## Install Steps

1. Setup drives/filesystem (TODO: figure out how I did that before)
2. Get this repo
3. Move and link config + hardware to appropriate hosts folder
4. Edit config for new system, just basic hardware and keep it minimal


## TODO
- Use nixos-hardware
- sort out btrfs maintenance stuff
